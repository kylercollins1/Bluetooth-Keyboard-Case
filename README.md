The purpose of this project is to build a bluetooth keyboard/ gamepad case that attaches to the Galaxy Note 10+ (keyboards compatible with other devices, excluding the note 10 half of the case) to allow for mechanical typing (similar to older flip phones) on a large screen phone. The keyboard consists of 2 parts, one for all the keys expected on a full sized keyboard, as well thumb sliders and gamepad buttons with 4 triggers located on the rear of the device. This device is uses a ESP32-WROOM-32D to connect through bluetooth to the phone. The case is 3d printed using a mixture of PLA filiment and TPE to provide both the structual support for the keyboard as well as protection for the phone.
